# The New Bottleneck
### 40 Years of Software History

> Strategic mode begins

# For 40 years, one bottleneck ruled `Engineering capacity`

**pause**

### Ideas were cheap. Execution was expensive.

> "That's why we hired. That's why we scaled."

[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

> Set up the inversion

# And then AI collapsed build-time

> The "wait, what?" moment

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

## The new reality:

- Code generation: near-instant
- Prototyping: hours not weeks
- Infrastructure: rented, not built

## The 4 Layers of the AI World

> Overview before diving in

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# Layer 1: Utility Providers

### The "Electricity Companies"

OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, HuggingFace

> "They provide raw intelligence + raw tokens. Commoditized scale."

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# Layer 2: The Orchestration Layer

### The "Vehicles"

Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Claude Code

> "System prompts, tooling, workflow harnesses. Important, but changes every 6 months."

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# Layer 3: Domain Libraries

### The Underrated Moat

> "This is Zeta's superpower"

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

[image: Financial iconography - no humans, a big treasure chest with documents, scrolls, credit cards, transactions, various books on compliance symbols etc]

## Not code libraries. `Knowledge` libraries.

> Emphasize the distinction

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# AI is only as powerful as the domain context it stands on

> Core insight

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# Whoever owns deep domain maps owns the future

> "An LLM can write code. It can't understand why that specific bank rejects that specific transaction type on weekends."

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

# Layer 4: The Human Layer

### The Sauce

> "This is you. This is what you bring."

---
[bg:dashed-bottom-left]

## What you provide:

- Taste
- Problem selection
- Architecture
- Context shaping
- Quality bar

> "This layer cannot be commoditized"

[section]

# The 7 Rules for Surviving the Vibe Era

> Section header — empowerment begins

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 1: Master Intent, Not Syntax

### Clear articulation > typing speed

---
[bg:grid-center]

# The bottleneck is no longer "Can you code it?"

**pause**

## It's now "Can you describe it?"

> Core shift

---
[bg:grid-center]

# The good prompt is indistinguishable from a great product spec

> Quotable insight

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 2: Context Is the New Compiler

### Prompting is not typing English

---
[bg:grid-center]

## It's defining:

- Ontology
- Allowed moves
- Boundaries
- Constraints

> "90% of the time when AI goes wrong, it's not the model. It's your context."

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Good context → Predictable AI

**pause**

# Bad context → Chaos

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 3: Own Domain Knowledge

### Models hallucinate; humans interpret

---
[bg:grid-center]

## If you know...

- Why NACH mandates fail on certain dates
- Why card BINs matter
- Why RBI's new circular affects various flows

> Zeta-specific examples

---
[bg:grid-center]

# No model replaces that

**pause**

## Become the person who tells the AI what domain looks like

> Empowerment

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 4: Develop Taste

### The only non-commoditizable skill

---
[bg:grid-center]

## Taste is:

- Knowing what "good" looks like
- Knowing which idea is worth building
- Knowing when something is simple enough

---
[bg:grid-center]

# An AI can give you 50 options

**pause**

## Taste is knowing which one is right

> Core distinction

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 5: Direct, Don't Type

# You're not a coder anymore
**pause**
today's programmers will be tomorrow's stenographers

---
[bg:grid-center]

## The future engineering loop:

Describe → Direct → Critique → Constrain → Regenerate → Integrate

> New workflow

---
[bg:grid-center]

[image: A music director conducting an 50 piece orchestra]

## Think of yourself as a director

> "You don't operate the camera. You say 'I want this shot to feel lonely.' Then you critique."

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 6: Build Strong Adjacent Structures

### Your adjacency map = your creativity amplifier

---
[bg:grid-center]

# The engineer who only knows code sees code solutions

**pause**

# The engineer who knows design, psychology, business sees ten times more

> Contrast

---
[bg:grid-center]

# AI expands what's reachable
**pause**
# infinitely

**pause**

## You decide what's worth reaching

> Balance

---
[bg:grid-center]

# Rule 7: Treat AI as Teammate, Not Tool

### Shift from commanding to collaborating

---
[bg:grid-center]

# A tool does what you say

**pause**

## A teammate pushes back, suggests, iterates

> "I talk to Claude like a colleague. 'I'm not sure about this approach, what do you think?'"
