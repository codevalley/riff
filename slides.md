# "The Illusion of Thinking"

---

### Logic problems

**pause**

### ...and declared them broken

> "The AI Twitter world went nuts. 'See! It's all hype!'"

---

[image: Anthropic logo]

# "The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking"
### Anthropic's response

> "Yes, that's the real title. AI researchers are petty and I'm here for it."

---

# The problem wasn't the models

**pause**

# It was the approach

> "When you test a new thing with old assumptions, you get old conclusions"

# We keep applying yesterday's frameworks

### "This is how PRs work"

**pause**

### "This is how we estimate"

> "We're all carrying mimetic behaviors — copying what worked before"

---

# The ground has shifted

### Time to think from first principles

> "Today, more than any day, we need to reset"

---

# So let's start with the uncomfortable question

> Build anticipation — pause before next slide

# Who Dies in 2026?

# Every few months, someone declares a funeral

# Here's what I've learned

> Shift to insight mode

---

# Roles don't die

**pause**

# `Bottlenecks` inside roles die

> This is the reframe — let it land

---

# What's actually getting killed:

> Set up the list

---

### Manual typing

> "Why type when you can describe?"

---

### Syntax fetishism

> "Nobody cares if you memorized the reduce function signature"

---

### Boilerplate generation

> "The CRUD endpoint you wrote 47 times? Gone."

---

### Pixel-pushing

> "CSS tweaking for 3 hours? The model does it in 3 seconds."

---

### Poor intent articulation

> "If you can't explain what you want, you're stuck"

---

### Working without context maps

> "Flying blind doesn't work when the AI needs a flight plan"

---

# The engineer who only knew syntax?

# Trouble.

# For 40 years, one bottleneck ruled:

**pause**

# `Engineering capacity`

# "We have a 6-month backlog"

### The universal complaint

> "That's why we hired. That's why we scaled. That's why engineering salaries went up."

---

# More engineers = More output

### The equation was simple

> Set up the inversion

# And then...

<!-- SECTION 3: Survival Rules      -->
<!-- ============================== -->

[image: Bold "7 RULES" graphic — survival guide aesthetic]

# The 7 Rules for Surviving the Vibe Era

> Section header

---

# Rule 1

## Master Intent, Not Syntax

> "Clear articulation > typing speed"

---

# The bottleneck is no longer...

**pause**

### "Can you code it?"

**pause**

# It's now...

**pause**

### "Can you describe it?"

> Core shift

---

# The best prompt is indistinguishable from a great product spec

> Quotable insight

---

# Rule 2

## Context Is the New Compiler

> "Prompting is not typing English"

---

### Ontology

**pause**

### Allowed moves

**pause**

### Boundaries

**pause**

### Constraints

> "It's defining these things"

---

# Good context → Predictable AI

**pause**

# Bad context → Chaos

> "90% of the time when AI goes wrong, it's not the model. It's your context."

---

# Rule 3

## Own Domain Knowledge

> "Models hallucinate; humans interpret"

---

# If you know...

**pause**

### Why NACH mandates fail on certain dates

**pause**

### Why card BINs matter

**pause**

### Why RBI's new circular affects our flows

> Zeta-specific examples

---

# No model replaces that

> Emphasis

---

# Become the person the AI can't replace

**pause**

# Become the person who tells the AI what domain looks like

> Empowerment

---

# Rule 4

## Develop Taste

> "The only non-commoditizable skill"

---

### Knowing what "good" looks like

**pause**

### Knowing which idea is worth building

**pause**

### Knowing when something is simple enough

> Building the definition

---

# An AI can give you 50 options

**pause**

# Taste is knowing which one is right

> Core distinction

---

# Rule 5

## Direct, Don't Type

> "You're not a coder anymore"

---

# The future engineering loop:

**pause**

### Describe → Direct → Critique → Constrain → Regenerate → Integrate

> New workflow

---

[image: Film director with megaphone, or orchestra conductor]

# Think of yourself as a film director

**pause**

# The AI is your very fast, very literal production crew

> "You don't operate the camera. You say 'I want this shot to feel lonely.' Then you critique."

---

# Rule 6

## Build Strong Adjacent Structures

> "Your adjacency map = your creativity amplifier"

---

# The engineer who only knows code...

**pause**

# ...sees code solutions

> First half

---

# The engineer who knows design, psychology, business...

**pause**

# ...sees ten times more

> Contrast

---

# AI expands what's reachable

**pause**

# You decide what's worth reaching

> Balance

---

# Rule 7

## Treat AI as Teammate, Not Tool

> "Shift from commanding to collaborating"

---

# A tool does what you say

**pause**

# A teammate pushes back, suggests, iterates

> Distinction

---

# The best results come from conversation, not instruction

> "I talk to Claude like a colleague. 'I'm not sure about this approach, what do you think?'"

## Don't Hide System Prompts from Users

> "The horseless carriage mistake"

---

# Early cars looked like carriages

# We're doing the same thing with AI

> "Hiding AI behind old UX patterns"

# Let users shape their own context

> Takeaway

---

# Pitfall 3

## Rewrite Over Refactor

> "New reality: rewriting is often faster"

---

# That code took 10 minutes to generate

**pause**

# Why spend 2 hours refactoring it?

> Challenge assumption

---

# Delete it. Regenerate it. Move on.

> Mindset shift

---

# Pitfall 4

## Think More Before Doing

> "Planning has MORE value now, not less"

---

# The cost of building the wrong thing hasn't changed

**pause**

# Except now you build the wrong thing faster

> Irony

---

# Think twice. Prompt once.

> Quotable

# Pitfall 5

## Move Away from "Chat"

# If your product is "chat with your X"...

**pause**

# You have 6 months before it's a feature in ChatGPT

> Reality check

---

# Your moat:
