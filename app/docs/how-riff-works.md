# How Riff Works

## What is Riff?

Riff turns your notes into stunning presentations. No templates. No dragging boxes around. Just write what you want to say, and Riff handles the rest.

Think of it as the opposite of PowerPoint. Instead of spending hours on layout, you spend minutes on content. Your ideas become slides automatically.

## Create a Deck in 2 Minutes

You have two ways to start:

**Import what you already have.** Drop in a Google Doc, paste your meeting notes, or export a conversation from ChatGPT. Riff converts it to slides instantly. No reformatting. No copy-paste gymnastics.

**Or just start typing.** Write in markdown - the same format you use in Notion, GitHub, or Slack. Headings become titles. Bullet points become... bullet points. It's that simple.

## Make It Yours

### Images That Appear Like Magic

Type `[image: description]` anywhere in your deck. Riff generates a matching image on the spot.

Don't like what you see? You have options:
- **Regenerate** with a different style
- **Upload** your own image
- **Restyle** any image with AI

Switch between versions anytime. All your variants are saved.

### Themes in Plain English

Forget color pickers and font dropdowns. Just describe what you want:

> "Make it look like Duolingo's brand - friendly, green, playful"

> "Dark mode with subtle purple accents, modern and minimal"

> "Warm and professional, like a high-end consulting deck"

Riff generates a complete theme - colors, fonts, spacing - all from your description.

## Editing Power

Everything is markdown, but you get superpowers:

**Reveal content on click.** Add `**pause**` between elements. They appear one at a time when presenting - perfect for building up a story.

**Speaker notes.** Start a line with `>` and it becomes a private note only you see during presentation.

**Background effects.** One line like `[bg:glow-bottom-left]` adds subtle ambient lighting. Grids, hatches, glows - all built in.

**Code that looks good.** Paste code blocks with syntax highlighting. Great for technical talks.

## Present, Share & Embed

When you're ready, hit **Publish**.

You get a shareable link instantly. Anyone with the link can view your deck - no sign-up required.

Want to embed it on your website? Copy the embed code and drop it into any page. Your Riff plays right there, fully interactive.

Present directly from Riff with keyboard shortcuts:
- Arrow keys to navigate
