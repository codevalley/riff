# Vibe world: Rules of survival
#vibeTC

## 🎭 1. The Actors in the New Creative Landscape
Introduce a simple model that reframes everything.
### A. Utility Providers / ISPs
These are the **electricity companies** of cognition:
* OpenAI
* Anthropic
* Groq
* Google Gemini
* Model providers on HuggingFace

They provide **raw intelligence + raw tokens**.Their job is commoditized scale.
**Key insight:**
Competing with utilities is pointless.Companies AND individuals should not anchor their identity here.

### B. The Orchestration Layer (“System Prompts, Tooling, Horses”)
This is where koomen.dev’s *horseless carriages* metaphor is brilliant:
* System prompts
* Local context shapers
* Workflow harnesses
* Gateways, guards, constraints
* Apps like Cursor, Windsurf, Supermaven

⠀These are the “vehicles” that let you *steer* the model.
This layer is **wildly changing**, and **everyone thinks it's the value**, but…
**Key insight:**
This layer is table stakes.Good to know, but not where the long-term advantage lies.

### C. The Domain Libraries
Not code libraries — **knowledge libraries**:
* Zeta’s payment knowledge
* Card networks
* Risk engines
* Payroll compliance
* Taxation rules
* Authentication context
* Digital banking primitives

⠀This is the most underrated asset.
**Key insight:**
AI is only as powerful as the domain context it stands on.Whoever owns deep domain maps owns the future.

### D. The Human Layer (“The Sauce”)
This is where the talk lands:
* Taste
* Problem selection
* Architecture
* Context shaping
* Constraints
* Quality bar
* Abstraction design
* Defining the *“what should exist in the world?”*

⠀This is the layer that **cannot be commoditized**.

# 🌋 2. The Burning Question
After explaining the actors, you frame the big tension:
*If utilities are free, and tools are cheap, what must we master to remain relevant?*
This is the **heart of the talk**.

# 🧠 3. The 5 Underlying Rules for Survival (The “Sauce”)
These are crisp survival laws for the vibe era.
You can present them like principles, as in *Inventing by Principle*.

# Rule 1 — Become a Master of Intent, Not Syntax
In the vibe world:
* Code is infinite
* Time is near-zero
* Syntax is irrelevant

⠀The only scarce skill:
*Stating what should exist clearly, precisely, and completely.*
This is PM + Eng + Design collapsing into **intent craftsmanship**.

# Rule 2 — Learn to Shape Context, Not Commands
Prompting is not typing English.
It is:
* Defining ontology
* Defining allowed moves
* Defining boundaries
* Defining constraints

⠀This is *architecture*, not “prompt engineering.”
Humans who shape context → AI becomes predictableHumans who do not → AI becomes chaos

# Rule 3 — Own Your Domain Knowledge
If you know payroll compliance, card networks, risk, APM, wallets, KYC, etc…**no model can replace that**.
Models can expand reasoning, but they cannot create deep institutional knowledge.
This rule tells the engineers:
### “Your career value is tied to mastering domain primitives.”

# Rule 4 — Build Taste: The Only Non-Replicable Asset
Taste =
* knowing what “good” looks like
* having aesthetic judgment
* knowing which idea is worth building
* knowing when something is simple enough

⠀No model has consistent taste.Humans will always outperform here.

# Rule 5 — Become a Director, Not a Typist
The future engineering loop:
* Describe
* Direct
* Critique
* Constrain
* Regenerate
* Integrate

⠀This is the role of a **creative director** rather than a traditional coder.
You teach the audience:
“AI doesn’t replace us. It promotes us.”

# 🚀 4. How Zeta Finds Its “Sauce”
You close the loop:
Zeta’s unique advantage is not “AI + LLM wrappers”.
It is:
* Deep financial domain knowledge
* Regulatory familiarity
* Massive transaction understanding
* Core banking primitives
* Strong engineering culture
* Clean architectural patterns

⠀AI can *amplify* Zeta, but cannot *replace* Zeta.

# 🎤 5. Why This Agenda Works Amazingly
This talk is:
* **Hierarchy-safe** (PMs, Eng, Design all feel represented)
* **Non-fearful** — “this is how we thrive”
* **Strategic** — great for leadership
* **Engaging** — the actor model invites jokes & visuals
* **Actionable** — clear survival rules
* **Inspirational** — ends with hope & clarity

⠀It also gives you natural permission to add a light **hands-on moment** if you want, but you’re not forced.
