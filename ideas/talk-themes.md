# Themes for the talk
#vibeTC

**6 strong framing directions**, each with:
* A compelling core question
* A tone / aura it creates
* Pros & cons
* What a talk under that theme could roughly look like

# 1. “Who Dies in 2026?” (Working title)
### Core Idea
Every few months someone claims:**“PMs are dead.”“Engineers are dead.”“Design is dead.”“IDE is dead.”**
But what *actually* dies? Not the roles — the **bottlenecks** inside them.
### Tone
Provocative. Funny. Insightful. Very high engagement.Sets you up as someone debunking lazy narratives.
### What the talk explores
* What *exactly* vibe coding murders?
* Which skills decay? Which skills become 10x more important?
* How AI shifts the value curve inside engineering, PM, UX
* The rise of *context engineering*, *adjacency mapping*, *intent shaping*

⠀Pros
* Audience laughs + thinks
* Gives you room for vivid examples
* Easy to make interactive (“vote: who dies?”)

⠀Cons
* Needs a slightly careful framing so it doesn’t look alarmist or flippant
* You’ll need a punchline (e.g., “Tools die. The creators evolve.”)

⠀
# 2\. “Clean Architecture for Vibe Coding”<!-- {"fold":true} -->
### Core Idea
If coding becomes a conversation, then the job becomes:**How do you set up the environment so the AI behaves predictably?**
### Tone
Practical. Hands-on. Highly respected by engineers.Makes you look like a “teacher of the new craft.”
### What the talk explores
* How to set up an AI-ready workstation
* How to structure projects so vibe coding *thrives* not *chaos’es*
* Guardrails, constraints, vocabularies, and domain shapes
* The “AI-DSL” mindset — how intent shapes generation
* A quick live example (optional)

⠀Pros
* Very actionable
* Engineers will LOVE this
* Easier to stay safe on stage
* Reinforces you as a leader shaping Zeta’s AI-first engineering culture

⠀Cons
* Slightly less “philosophical magic”
* Must be crisp or it becomes a workshop, not a talk

⠀
# 3\. “The New Bottleneck”<!-- {"fold":true} -->
### Core Idea
For 40 years, **engineering capacity** was the limiting reagent of software.Now:
* Code is cheap
* Prototyping is instant
* Infrastructure is rentedSo what becomes expensive?

⠀Tone
Insightful. Strategic.Positions you as someone explaining the future of software-making.
### The talk explores
* Historically: engineering → design → research → ideas
* Now: what is the scarce skill?
* Possibly: **clarity of intent**
* Possibly: **taste**
* Possibly: **problem selection**
* Possibly: **context modelling**

⠀And:
“What does Zeta invest in now to be ready for this inversion?”
### Pros
* High relevance to leadership and PMs
* Creates aha moments
* Works even without demo
* You can tie it to vibe coding seamlessly (“when code is cheap, intent becomes expensive”)

⠀Cons
* Needs sharp examples
* Less fun/humorous than idea #1

⠀
# 4\. “Vibe Coding as the Return of the Craftsman”<!-- {"fold":true} -->
### Core Idea
AI does the typing.Humans now do what humans are best at:
* shaping constraints
* providing taste
* making tradeoffs

⠀Tone
Inspirational + thoughtfulGreat for giving “Inventing by Principle” vibes
### Pros
* Feels elevated
* You can include philosophy, architecture, and demo
* Good balance between deep and accessible

⠀Cons
* Requires tight storytelling
* Slightly abstract if not grounded in examples

⠀
# 5\. “The Adjacent Possible: How AI Expands Creation”<!-- {"fold":true} -->
### Core Idea
Borrow Stuart Kauffman’s “adjacent possible”:Humans imagine → AI expands → humans choose → AI builds →
You show how the adjacency map expands exponentially.
### Tone
Inventive. Conceptual. Beautiful.Gives you that “wow, hadn’t thought about it like that” reaction.
### Pros
* Intellectual + practical
* Explains *why* vibe coding works, not just *how*
* You can visualise adjacency live with an example

⠀Cons
* Needs a clean metaphor
* Harder to land jokes

⠀
# 6\. “10 Principles for the AI-First Builder”<!-- {"fold":true} -->
*(Inspired by “Inventing by Principle”)*
### Core Idea
Rather than “vibe coding demo”, you share the **principles** that govern creation in 2026:
Examples:
* Intent > Syntax
* Context is the new compiler
* Guardrails are the new framework
* Feedback loops are the new IDE
* Architecture becomes a conversation

⠀Tone
Crisp. Philsophical. Memorable.Like the original talk that inspired you.
### Pros
* Easy to embed stories
* Zero fear of live demo failing
* Very quotable principles
* Works for all roles (PM, eng, design)

⠀Cons
* Slightly more prep work
* Needs strong examples to avoid being abstract

⠀



# Great — this fourth thread is actually a **very powerful framing**, because it gives the audience *clarity* and *agency* in a world that looks like it’s moving too fast.
Let’s explore this angle deeply and cleanly.

# 🌐 7. “How to Stay Relevant in the Vibe World: The New Rules of Survival”
This is a **high-agency**, **non-fear**, **strategic** talk about:
* The actors
* The tectonic shifts
* What becomes a commodity
* What stays scarce
* And most importantly, **what Zeta must do to keep our “secret sauce”**

⠀It’s visionary **and** deeply practical.
Below is a structured form of this theme, with clarity on:
* What it could cover
* How it feels
* Why it lands
* What agenda it naturally shapes into
# ⭐ Core Idea
*Everyone is scared AI will make them irrelevant.The truth is: only the people who misunderstand the new landscape will be irrelevant.*
This talk teaches the **landscape** and the **rules**.

# Possible Final Agendas (Combinations)
Let me propose 3 blended agendas — we can refine whichever direction feels closer to you:

# Agenda A (Provocative + Strategic)
**Title:** *“Who Actually Dies in 2026? The Truth Behind Vibe Coding”*
1 Opening: Why everyone says their job is dead
2 What AI kills inside roles (not roles)
3 The new bottleneck (intent, taste, context)
4 Demo: building with adjacency (optional)
5 What teams must do to survive 2026
6 Closing: The rise of the intent engineer

⠀This is your most entertaining talk.

# Agenda B (Practical + Engaging)
**Title:** *“Clean Architecture for a Vibe-First World”*
1 Why vibe coding fails for most people (chaos by default)
2 Introducing vibe-safe architecture
3 How to structure domains, constraints, vocabularies
4 Hands-on: shape → generate → refine
5 Guardrails, checklists, workflows
6 Closing: The future of software as conversation

⠀This lands beautifully with engineers.

# Agenda C (Inspirational + Insightful)
**Title:** *“The New Bottleneck: What Matters When Code Is Free”*
1 History of bottlenecks in software
2 The inversion: engineering is no longer scarce
3 What becomes expensive now (clarity, articulation, taste)
4 Vibe coding as the amplifier of intent
5 How Zeta teams should reorganise thinking
6 Closing: We are entering an age where code is not written — it is directed

⠀This gives you a “thought leader” persona.
