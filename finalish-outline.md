This is a **beautiful, structurally tight, high-impact agenda**.
It forms a natural progression from *provocation → insight → empowerment → practice*.

Let me refine the four sections into a **coherent narrative arc**, ensure each has a strong identity, and show how they interlock even if you skip some parts.

---

# 🔥 **THE 4-SECTION MASTER AGENDA**

*(Designed to work as a single talk OR as two independent parts)*

---

# **SECTION 1 — “Who Dies in 2026?”**

**Tone:** Provocative, humorous, high-energy opener.

**Purpose:** Break fears → reset the frame → grab attention.

### What this section does:

* Expose the *lazy* claims (“PMs are dead”, “Engineers are dead”, “Design is dead”).
* Show the audience the **real** things that die:

  * Manual typing
  * Syntax fetishism
  * Boilerplate
  * Pixel-pushing
  * Poor intent articulation
  * Repetitive CRUD thinking
  * Working without context maps

**Punchline:**

> “Roles don’t die. Bottlenecks do.”

This line sets you up perfectly for Section 2.

**Option to shorten:** You can turn this into a 3-minute monologue if time is tight.

---

# **SECTION 2 — “The New Bottleneck”**

**Tone:** Strategic, big-picture, thought-leader mode.

**Purpose:** Explain why the world is shifting and *what actually becomes scarce*.

### What this section explores:

* 40 years of software history: engineering was the scarce currency
* AI collapses build-time → engineering is no longer the primary bottleneck
* So what becomes expensive now?

You introduce **the new scarce currencies**:

1. **Intent clarity**
2. **Taste / judgment**
3. **Context modeling**
4. **Problem selection**
5. **Abstraction design**
6. **Domain knowledge**

This sets the stage for survival rules.

**Punchline:**

> “When code becomes free, thinking becomes expensive.”

This elegantly transitions into Section 3.

**Optional compression:** This section can be done as a 1-slide “concept inversion” if needed.

---

# **SECTION 3 — “Survival Rules for the Vibe World”**

**Tone:** Empowering, actionable, principle-driven.

**Purpose:** Give the audience a **playbook for not becoming irrelevant**.

Here you list **5–7 crisp rules**, for example:

### **Rule 1 — Master Intent, Not Syntax**

Clear articulation > typing speed.

### **Rule 2 — Context Is the New Compiler**

Architecture = constraints that shape the model.

### **Rule 3 — Own Domain Knowledge**

Models hallucinate; humans interpret, contextualise, and judge.

### **Rule 4 — Develop Taste**

The only non-commoditizable skill.

### **Rule 5 — Direct, Don’t Type**

The future engineer = creative director + architect + critic.

### **Rule 6 — Build Strong Adjacent Structures**

Your adjacency map = your creativity amplifier.

### **Rule 7 — Treat AI as a Teammate, Not a Tool**

Shift from “commanding” → “collaborating”.

**Punchline:**

> “AI kills the parts of us that never mattered.
> It amplifies the parts that always did.”

This is your philosophical high point.

**Option to skip:** This section is self-contained; you can turn it into a standalone talk.

---

# **SECTION 4 — “The Clean Handbook: How to Work in a Vibe-First World”**

**Tone:** Practical, structured, hands-on, confident.

**Purpose:** Show them *how* to actually survive using a clean framework.

This is the **manual / checklist / method**.

### What the handbook includes:

* How to set up your “vibe coding” environment
* How to structure domains for LLM generation
* How to create guardrails (constraints + ontology + slots)
* The shape of a good prompt = Problem → Constraints → Entities → Behaviors → Output expectations
* The iteration loop:

  * Draft → Critique → Constrain → Improve
* The “don’t do these” anti-pattern list
* A 5-minute live mini-demo (optional)

This is the tangible takeaway.

**Punchline:**

> “Vibe coding is not magic — it’s clean thinking made executable.”

This is your closure.

**Optional separation:**
This entire Section 4 can be a **Part 2 workshop** on another day.

---

# 🧩 HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER (THE NARRATIVE ARC)

1 → shocks the audience
2 → explains the real shift
3 → empowers them psychologically
4 → gives them a practical toolkit

It’s a perfect pyramid:

**Fear → Insight → Empowerment → Capability**

---

# 🎤 FLEXIBLE MODES (Time-Safe Design)

### **Full 40–45 min talk**

All 4 sections with crisp transitions.

### **20–25 min short talk**

Do:

* 1 (shortened)
* 2
* 4 (as a teaser)

Skip 3 if needed.

### **Two-part format**

**Part 1:**
1 + 2 + (shortened) 3 → “Why vibe coding changes everything”

**Part 2:**
3 + 4 → “How to thrive in the vibe era”

---

# 🔧 NEXT STEP

I can now:

* Polish these 4 sections into **slide-ready bullet flow**
* Or turn it into a **tight keynote narrative**
* Or help you rehearse transitions and punchlines
* Or prepare the **clean handbook** as a handout

Which direction do you want to refine next?
