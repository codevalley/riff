# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a content repository containing notes, outlines, and ideas for a presentation about "vibe coding" and AI's impact on software development roles. There is no code to build or test.

## Repository Structure

- `finalish-outline.md` - Main 4-section master agenda for the talk
- `ideas/` - Supporting theme explorations and detailed notes
  - `talk-themes.md` - 7 potential talk theme directions with pros/cons
  - `surving-vibe.md` - Detailed "survival rules" framework and actor model

## Content Themes

The talk explores:
- What AI "kills" in software roles (bottlenecks, not roles themselves)
- The new scarcities: intent clarity, taste, context modeling, domain knowledge
- Survival rules for the "vibe coding" era
- Practical frameworks for AI-first development
